> YTPS into a website

YTPS stands for Youtube Terminal Play and Search. It is a Beautiful CLI I wrote in python whcih utilizes youtube-search and the youtube-search-python modules to scrap youtube and play it locally. I was learning flask, so I thought of implementing this into a smalll website. All the backend is written in python and is completly open source. Sorry for the goofy styling. I am not very good with css.

I am still learning flask and if I learn any skill which I can use in this, I will implement it. For now, you can only see the results without the involvment of youtube at all. You have the option to play the video in the inbuilt player, but it is still in beta, so expect bugs and if you find any, report them to issues. If you like this project and hope to contribute to it, clone the github repository and send me a pull request. Any help is appreciated.

<u>Future Goals for the Project</u>

- Write a 'about' page and a better README.md :)
- Make Backend faster
- Improve the styling ðŸ˜Š

If you have any issues or want to give on advice on any ascept of the project, legal or otherwise, please email me or you can always reach me on matrix. Hope you enjoy an almost youtube free youtube experince. ðŸ˜„
